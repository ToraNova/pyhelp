# PYHELP
a collection of python snippets to help kickstart python development. these include single-file-libs as well as sample scripts to jog memory and move around hard-to-remember syntax.

## Initialization
the libs used by the snippets here (i.e. paho-mqtt) are managed by a virtual environment. to initialize:
```
python -m venv .
. bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
